This project focuses on evaluating and comparing various feature extraction methods—SIFT, 
ORB, and KAZE—for object recognition within a dataset of images. 

The process involves loading and splitting the dataset into training and 
testing sets, applying each feature extraction method to detect keypoints and compute 
descriptors, and then using these descriptors for object recognition via the k-Nearest 
Neighbors (k-NN) matcher.

The performance of each method is assessed and visualized 
through confusion matrices, providing insights into their accuracy and effectiveness in 
correctly identifying objects.
